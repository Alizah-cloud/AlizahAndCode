                <p>This project involves simulating inheritance in an object-oriented programming context. I created a family tree using classes to represent individuals and their relationships. The task emphasizes the understanding of object-oriented principles like inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.</p>
              </div>

              <div class="project-card">
                <h2>Project 12: Speller</h2>
                <p>The objective was to write a program that checks the spelling of words in a text file. I implementEd a spell-checker using techniques like hash tables or tries. This helped me work with string manipulation, file I/O, and memory management.</p>
              </div>

              <div class="project-card">
                <h2>Project 13: DNA</h2>
                <p>In this project, I wrote a program to compare DNA sequences, specifically focusing on how similar a person's DNA is to that of others. I needed to parse a DNA sequence, search for specific motifs, and compare them to a known database of sequences. This project introduced me to basic string manipulation, arrays, and algorithms for searching.</p>
              </div>

              <div class="project-card">
